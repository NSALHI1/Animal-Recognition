# 1. Sample Image Input:
# Here we will provide an example of uploading an image to the Gradio interface.
 you can use the image in this repositry ("elephant.webp") 

# Let's assume we have a sample image of a lion saved as 'sample_lion_image.jpg'.
# This image will be uploaded to the Gradio interface to see the outputs.

from PIL import Image

# Load a sample image of a lion (replace this with any image path)
sample_image = Image.open("sample_lion_image.jpg")
sample_image.show()

# After uploading this image in the Gradio app, the following things will happen:
# 1. The system will generate a caption describing the image.
# 2. The pipeline will identify the animal (lion in this case).
# 3. You will get additional facts about lions from the pre-defined context.
# 4. The caption and facts will be translated to Arabic.
# 5. An audio narration of the caption will be generated.

# Try uploading different animal images like a tiger or an elephant to see how the pipeline adapts.

# For example:
# Upload 'sample_tiger_image.jpg' to the interface and observe the outputs!
