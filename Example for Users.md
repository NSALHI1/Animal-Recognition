# Here we will provide an example of the project :
- you can use the image from this repository:
[elephant.webp](https://github.com/NSALHI1/Animal-Recognition/blob/main/elephant.webp)

- Use Hugging face space to test the system:
[Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Norahsal/Animals)

# After uploading this image in the Gradio, the following things will happen:
 1. The system will generate a caption describing the image.
 2. The pipeline will identify the animal (elephant in this case).
 3. You will get additional facts about elephants from the pre-defined context.
 4. The caption and facts will be translated to Arabic.
 5. An audio narration of the caption will be generated.

* Try uploading different animal images like a tiger or a lion to see how the pipeline adapts.
